# Android Studio Exercise: City Info
This is a simple Android application built with Java in Android Studio. The exercise involves displaying a list of countries (Italy, England, and France) with radio buttons. When the user selects a country, a list of three major cities for that country is displayed. Clicking on a city opens a new screen that shows a short description of the city and an image representing it.

A "reset" button allows users to clear their selection, hide the list of cities, and return the app to its initial state.

Created for academic purposes.
